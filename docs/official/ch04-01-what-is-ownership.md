## What Is Ownership? 什么是所有权？

所有权（ownership）是 Rust 用于如何管理内存的一组规则。所有程序都必须管理其运行时使用计算机内存的方式。一些语言中具有垃圾回收机制，在程序运行时有规律地寻找不再使用的内存；在另一些语言中，程序员必须亲自分配和释放内存。Rust 则选择了第三种方式：通过所有权系统管理内存，编译器在编译时会根据一系列的规则进行检查。如果违反了任何这些规则，程序都不能编译。在运行时，所有权系统的任何功能都不会减慢程序。

_Ownership_ is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory.
All programs have to manage the way they use a computer’s memory while running.
Some languages have garbage collection that regularly looks for no-longer-used
memory as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer must explicitly
allocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach: memory is managed
through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks. If
any of the rules are violated, the program won’t compile. None of the features
of ownership will slow down your program while it’s running.

因为所有权对很多程序员来说都是一个新概念，需要一些时间来适应。好消息是随着你对 Rust 和所有权系统的规则越来越有经验，你就越能自然地编写出安全和高效的代码。持之以恒！

Because ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take some time
to get used to. The good news is that the more experienced you become with Rust
and the rules of the ownership system, the easier you’ll find it to naturally
develop code that is safe and efficient. Keep at it!

当你理解了所有权，你将有一个坚实的基础来理解那些使 Rust 独特的功能。在本章中，你将通过完成一些示例来学习所有权，这些示例基于一个常用的数据结构：字符串。

When you understand ownership, you’ll have a solid foundation for understanding
the features that make Rust unique. In this chapter, you’ll learn ownership by
working through some examples that focus on a very common data structure:
strings.

> 在很多语言中，你并不需要经常考虑到栈与堆。不过在像 Rust 这样的系统编程语言中，值是位于栈上还是堆上在更大程度上影响了语言的行为以及为何必须做出这样的抉择。我们会在本章的稍后部分描述所有权与栈和堆相关的内容，所以这里只是一个用来预热的简要解释。

>
> 栈和堆都是代码在运行时可供使用的内存，但是它们的结构不同。栈以放入值的顺序存储值并以相反顺序取出值。这也被称作 后进先出（last in, first out）。想象一下一叠盘子：当增加更多盘子时，把它们放在盘子堆的顶部，当需要盘子时，也从顶部拿走。不能从中间也不能从底部增加或拿走盘子！增加数据叫做 进栈（pushing onto the stack），而移出数据叫做 出栈（popping off the stack）。栈中的所有数据都必须占用已知且固定的大小。在编译时大小未知或大小可能变化的数据，要改为存储在堆上。

> 堆是缺乏组织的：当向堆放入数据时，你要请求一定大小的空间。内存分配器（memory allocator）在堆的某处找到一块足够大的空位，把它标记为已使用，并返回一个表示该位置地址的 指针（pointer）。这个过程称作 在堆上分配内存（allocating on the heap），有时简称为 “分配”（allocating）。（将数据推入栈中并不被认为是分配）。因为指向放入堆中数据的指针是已知的并且大小是固定的，你可以将该指针存储在栈上，不过当需要实际数据时，必须访问指针。想象一下去餐馆就座吃饭。当进入时，你说明有几个人，餐馆员工会找到一个够大的空桌子并领你们过去。如果有人来迟了，他们也可以通过询问来找到你们坐在哪。

> 入栈比在堆上分配内存要快，因为（入栈时）分配器无需为存储新数据去搜索内存空间；其位置总是在栈顶。相比之下，在堆上分配内存则需要更多的工作，这是因为分配器必须首先找到一块足够存放数据的内存空间，并接着做一些记录为下一次分配做准备。

> 访问堆上的数据比访问栈上的数据慢，因为必须通过指针来访问。现代处理器在内存中跳转越少就越快（缓存）。继续类比，假设有一个服务员在餐厅里处理多个桌子的点菜。在一个桌子报完所有菜后再移动到下一个桌子是最有效率的。从桌子 A 听一个菜，接着桌子 B 听一个菜，然后再桌子 A，然后再桌子 B 这样的流程会更加缓慢。出于同样原因，处理器在处理的数据彼此较近的时候（比如在栈上）比较远的时候（比如可能在堆上）能更好的工作。

> 跟踪哪部分代码正在使用堆上的哪些数据，最大限度的减少堆上的重复数据的数量，以及清理堆上不再使用的数据确保不会耗尽空间，这些问题正是所有权系统要处理的。一旦理解了所有权，你就不需要经常考虑栈和堆了，不过明白了所有权的主要目的就是管理堆数据，能够帮助解释为什么所有权要以这种方式工作。

### Ownership Rules 所有权规则

首先，让我们看一下所有权的规则。当我们通过举例说明时，请谨记这些规则：

First, let’s take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind as we
work through the examples that illustrate them:

- Rust 中的每一个值都有一个 所有者
- Each value in Rust has an _owner_.
- 值在任一时刻有且只有一个所有者
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- 当所有者（变量）离开作用域，这个值将被丢弃
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

### Variable Scope 变量作用域

既然我们已经掌握了基本语法，将不会在之后的例子中包含 fn main() { 代码，所以如果你是一路跟过来的，必须手动将之后例子的代码放入一个 main 函数中。这样，例子将显得更加简明，使我们可以关注实际细节而不是样板代码。

Now that we’re past basic Rust syntax, we won’t include all the `fn main() {`
code in examples, so if you’re following along, make sure to put the following
examples inside a `main` function manually. As a result, our examples will be a
bit more concise, letting us focus on the actual details rather than
boilerplate code.

在所有权的第一个例子中，我们看看一些变量的 作用域（scope）。作用域是一个项（item）在程序中有效的范围。假设有这样一个变量：

As a first example of ownership, we’ll look at the _scope_ of some variables. A
scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid. Take the
following variable:

```rust
let s = "hello";
```

变量 s 绑定到了一个字符串字面值，这个字符串值是硬编码进程序代码中的。这个变量从声明的点开始直到当前 作用域 结束时都是有效的。示例 4-1 中的注释标明了变量 s 在何处是有效的。

The variable `s` refers to a string literal, where the value of the string is
hardcoded into the text of our program. The variable is valid from the point at
which it’s declared until the end of the current _scope_. Listing 4-1 shows a
program with comments annotating where the variable `s` would be valid.

```rust
 {                      // s 在这里无效，它尚未声明
        let s = "hello";   // 从此处起，s 是有效的

        // 使用 s
    }                      // 此作用域已结束，s 不再有效
```

<span class="caption">
示例 4-1：一个变量和其有效的作用域
Listing 4-1: A variable and the scope in which it is
valid</span>

换句话说，这里有两个重要的时间点：

In other words, there are two important points in time here:

- 当 s 进入作用域 时，它就是有效的。
- When `s` comes _into_ scope, it is valid.
- 这一直持续到它 离开作用域 为止。
- It remains valid until it goes _out of_ scope.

目前为止，变量是否有效与作用域的关系跟其他编程语言是类似的。现在我们在此基础上介绍 String 类型。

At this point, the relationship between scopes and when variables are valid is
similar to that in other programming languages. Now we’ll build on top of this
understanding by introducing the `String` type.

### The `String` Type 字符串类型

为了演示所有权的规则，我们需要一个比第三章 [“数据类型”][data-types] 中讲到的都要复杂的数据类型。前面介绍的类型都是已知大小的，可以存储在栈中，并且当离开作用域时被移出栈，如果代码的另一部分需要在不同的作用域中使用相同的值，可以快速简单地复制它们来创建一个新的独立实例。不过我们需要寻找一个存储在堆上的数据来探索 Rust 是如何知道该在何时清理数据的。

To illustrate the rules of ownership, we need a data type that is more complex
than those we covered in the [“Data Types”][data-types]<!-- ignore --> section
of Chapter 3. The types covered previously are of a known size, can be stored
on the stack and popped off the stack when their scope is over, and can be
quickly and trivially copied to make a new, independent instance if another
part of code needs to use the same value in a different scope. But we want to
look at data that is stored on the heap and explore how Rust knows when to
clean up that data, and the `String` type is a great example.

我们会专注于 String 与所有权相关的部分。这些方面也同样适用于标准库提供的或你自己创建的其他复杂数据类型。在[第八章][ch8]会更深入地讲解 String。

We’ll concentrate on the parts of `String` that relate to ownership. These
aspects also apply to other complex data types, whether they are provided by
the standard library or created by you. We’ll discuss `String` in more depth in
[Chapter 8][ch8]<!-- ignore -->.

我们已经见过字符串字面值，即被硬编码进程序里的字符串值。字符串字面值是很方便的，不过它们并不适合使用文本的每一种场景。原因之一就是它们是不可变的。另一个原因是并非所有字符串的值都能在编写代码时就知道：例如，要是想获取用户输入并存储该怎么办呢？为此，Rust 有另一种字符串类型，String。这个类型管理被分配到堆上的数据，所以能够存储在编译时未知大小的文本。可以使用 from 函数基于字符串字面值来创建 String，如下：

We’ve already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded into our
program. String literals are convenient, but they aren’t suitable for every
situation in which we may want to use text. One reason is that they’re
immutable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write
our code: for example, what if we want to take user input and store it? For
these situations, Rust has a second string type, `String`. This type manages
data allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that
is unknown to us at compile time. You can create a `String` from a string
literal using the `from` function, like so:

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
```

The double colon `::` operator allows us to namespace this particular `from`
function under the `String` type rather than using some sort of name like
`string_from`. We’ll discuss this syntax more in the [“Method
Syntax”][method-syntax]<!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 5, and when we talk
about namespacing with modules in [“Paths for Referring to an Item in the
Module Tree”][paths-module-tree]<!-- ignore --> in Chapter 7.

This kind of string _can_ be mutated:

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-01-can-mutate-string/src/main.rs:here}}
```

So, what’s the difference here? Why can `String` be mutated but literals
cannot? The difference is in how these two types deal with memory.

### Memory and Allocation

In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so the
text is hardcoded directly into the final executable. This is why string
literals are fast and efficient. But these properties only come from the string
literal’s immutability. Unfortunately, we can’t put a blob of memory into the
binary for each piece of text whose size is unknown at compile time and whose
size might change while running the program.

With the `String` type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text,
we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time,
to hold the contents. This means:

- The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.
- We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we’re done with
  our `String`.

That first part is done by us: when we call `String::from`, its implementation
requests the memory it needs. This is pretty much universal in programming
languages.

However, the second part is different. In languages with a _garbage collector
(GC)_, the GC keeps track of and cleans up memory that isn’t being used
anymore, and we don’t need to think about it. In most languages without a GC,
it’s our responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and to
call code to explicitly free it, just as we did to request it. Doing this
correctly has historically been a difficult programming problem. If we forget,
we’ll waste memory. If we do it too early, we’ll have an invalid variable. If
we do it twice, that’s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one `allocate` with
exactly one `free`.

Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the
variable that owns it goes out of scope. Here’s a version of our scope example
from Listing 4-1 using a `String` instead of a string literal:

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-02-string-scope/src/main.rs:here}}
```

There is a natural point at which we can return the memory our `String` needs
to the allocator: when `s` goes out of scope. When a variable goes out of
scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called
[`drop`][drop]<!-- ignore -->, and it’s where the author of `String` can put
the code to return the memory. Rust calls `drop` automatically at the closing
curly bracket.

> Note: In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item’s
> lifetime is sometimes called _Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)_.
> The `drop` function in Rust will be familiar to you if you’ve used RAII
> patterns.

This pattern has a profound impact on the way Rust code is written. It may seem
simple right now, but the behavior of code can be unexpected in more
complicated situations when we want to have multiple variables use the data
we’ve allocated on the heap. Let’s explore some of those situations now.

<!-- Old heading. Do not remove or links may break. -->

<a id="ways-variables-and-data-interact-move"></a>

#### Variables and Data Interacting with Move

Multiple variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust.
Let’s look at an example using an integer in Listing 4-2.

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/listing-04-02/src/main.rs:here}}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 4-2: Assigning the integer value of variable `x`
to `y`</span>

We can probably guess what this is doing: “bind the value `5` to `x`; then make
a copy of the value in `x` and bind it to `y`.” We now have two variables, `x`
and `y`, and both equal `5`. This is indeed what is happening, because integers
are simple values with a known, fixed size, and these two `5` values are pushed
onto the stack.

Now let’s look at the `String` version:

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-03-string-move/src/main.rs:here}}
```

This looks very similar, so we might assume that the way it works would be the
same: that is, the second line would make a copy of the value in `s1` and bind
it to `s2`. But this isn’t quite what happens.

Take a look at Figure 4-1 to see what is happening to `String` under the
covers. A `String` is made up of three parts, shown on the left: a pointer to
the memory that holds the contents of the string, a length, and a capacity.
This group of data is stored on the stack. On the right is the memory on the
heap that holds the contents.

<img alt="Two tables: the first table contains the representation of s1 on the
stack, consisting of its length (5), capacity (5), and a pointer to the first
value in the second table. The second table contains the representation of the
string data on the heap, byte by byte." src="img/trpl04-01.svg" class="center"
style="width: 50%;" />

<span class="caption">Figure 4-1: Representation in memory of a `String`
holding the value `"hello"` bound to `s1`</span>

The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the `String` are
currently using. The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the
`String` has received from the allocator. The difference between length and
capacity matters, but not in this context, so for now, it’s fine to ignore the
capacity.

When we assign `s1` to `s2`, the `String` data is copied, meaning we copy the
pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the
data on the heap that the pointer refers to. In other words, the data
representation in memory looks like Figure 4-2.

<img alt="Three tables: tables s1 and s2 representing those strings on the
stack, respectively, and both pointing to the same string data on the heap."
src="img/trpl04-02.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" />

<span class="caption">Figure 4-2: Representation in memory of the variable `s2`
that has a copy of the pointer, length, and capacity of `s1`</span>

The representation does _not_ look like Figure 4-3, which is what memory would
look like if Rust instead copied the heap data as well. If Rust did this, the
operation `s2 = s1` could be very expensive in terms of runtime performance if
the data on the heap were large.

<img alt="Four tables: two tables representing the stack data for s1 and s2,
and each points to its own copy of string data on the heap."
src="img/trpl04-03.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" />

<span class="caption">Figure 4-3: Another possibility for what `s2 = s1` might
do if Rust copied the heap data as well</span>

Earlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically
calls the `drop` function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable. But
Figure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. This is a
problem: when `s2` and `s1` go out of scope, they will both try to free the
same memory. This is known as a _double free_ error and is one of the memory
safety bugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory
corruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

To ensure memory safety, after the line `let s2 = s1;`, Rust considers `s1` as
no longer valid. Therefore, Rust doesn’t need to free anything when `s1` goes
out of scope. Check out what happens when you try to use `s1` after `s2` is
created; it won’t work:

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-04-cant-use-after-move/src/main.rs:here}}
```

You’ll get an error like this because Rust prevents you from using the
invalidated reference:

```console
{{#include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-04-cant-use-after-move/output.txt}}
```

If you’ve heard the terms _shallow copy_ and _deep copy_ while working with
other languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity
without copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow copy. But
because Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of being called a
shallow copy, it’s known as a _move_. In this example, we would say that `s1`
was _moved_ into `s2`. So, what actually happens is shown in Figure 4-4.

<img alt="Three tables: tables s1 and s2 representing those strings on the
stack, respectively, and both pointing to the same string data on the heap.
Table s1 is grayed out be-cause s1 is no longer valid; only s2 can be used to
access the heap data." src="img/trpl04-04.svg" class="center" style="width:
50%;" />

<span class="caption">Figure 4-4: Representation in memory after `s1` has been
invalidated</span>

That solves our problem! With only `s2` valid, when it goes out of scope it
alone will free the memory, and we’re done.

In addition, there’s a design choice that’s implied by this: Rust will never
automatically create “deep” copies of your data. Therefore, any _automatic_
copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance.

<!-- Old heading. Do not remove or links may break. -->

<a id="ways-variables-and-data-interact-clone"></a>

#### Variables and Data Interacting with Clone

If we _do_ want to deeply copy the heap data of the `String`, not just the
stack data, we can use a common method called `clone`. We’ll discuss method
syntax in Chapter 5, but because methods are a common feature in many
programming languages, you’ve probably seen them before.

Here’s an example of the `clone` method in action:

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-05-clone/src/main.rs:here}}
```

This works just fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown in Figure 4-3,
where the heap data _does_ get copied.

When you see a call to `clone`, you know that some arbitrary code is being
executed and that code may be expensive. It’s a visual indicator that something
different is going on.

#### Stack-Only Data: Copy

There’s another wrinkle we haven’t talked about yet. This code using
integers—part of which was shown in Listing 4-2—works and is valid:

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-06-copy/src/main.rs:here}}
```

But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don’t have a call to
`clone`, but `x` is still valid and wasn’t moved into `y`.

The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile
time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick
to make. That means there’s no reason we would want to prevent `x` from being
valid after we create the variable `y`. In other words, there’s no difference
between deep and shallow copying here, so calling `clone` wouldn’t do anything
different from the usual shallow copying, and we can leave it out.

Rust has a special annotation called the `Copy` trait that we can place on
types that are stored on the stack, as integers are (we’ll talk more about
traits in [Chapter 10][traits]<!-- ignore -->). If a type implements the `Copy`
trait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied,
making them still valid after assignment to another variable.

Rust won’t let us annotate a type with `Copy` if the type, or any of its parts,
has implemented the `Drop` trait. If the type needs something special to happen
when the value goes out of scope and we add the `Copy` annotation to that type,
we’ll get a compile-time error. To learn about how to add the `Copy` annotation
to your type to implement the trait, see [“Derivable
Traits”][derivable-traits]<!-- ignore --> in Appendix C.

So, what types implement the `Copy` trait? You can check the documentation for
the given type to be sure, but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar
values can implement `Copy`, and nothing that requires allocation or is some
form of resource can implement `Copy`. Here are some of the types that
implement `Copy`:

- All the integer types, such as `u32`.
- The Boolean type, `bool`, with values `true` and `false`.
- All the floating-point types, such as `f64`.
- The character type, `char`.
- Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`. For example,
  `(i32, i32)` implements `Copy`, but `(i32, String)` does not.

### Ownership and Functions

The mechanics of passing a value to a function are similar to those when
assigning a value to a variable. Passing a variable to a function will move or
copy, just as assignment does. Listing 4-3 has an example with some annotations
showing where variables go into and out of scope.

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/listing-04-03/src/main.rs}}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 4-3: Functions with ownership and scope
annotated</span>

If we tried to use `s` after the call to `takes_ownership`, Rust would throw a
compile-time error. These static checks protect us from mistakes. Try adding
code to `main` that uses `s` and `x` to see where you can use them and where
the ownership rules prevent you from doing so.

### Return Values and Scope

Returning values can also transfer ownership. Listing 4-4 shows an example of a
function that returns some value, with similar annotations as those in Listing
4-3.

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/listing-04-04/src/main.rs}}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 4-4: Transferring ownership of return
values</span>

The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: assigning a
value to another variable moves it. When a variable that includes data on the
heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by `drop` unless ownership
of the data has been moved to another variable.

While this works, taking ownership and then returning ownership with every
function is a bit tedious. What if we want to let a function use a value but
not take ownership? It’s quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to
be passed back if we want to use it again, in addition to any data resulting
from the body of the function that we might want to return as well.

Rust does let us return multiple values using a tuple, as shown in Listing 4-5.

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/listing-04-05/src/main.rs}}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 4-5: Returning ownership of parameters</span>

But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept that should be
common. Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for using a value without
transferring ownership, called _references_.
